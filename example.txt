This is an example text file for the readme-mcp project.

The readme-mcp is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools for reading files, specifically designed to read AGENTS.md files from project roots.

Features:
- Reads files from the working directory
- Supports multiple ways to specify the working directory
- Provides error handling for file operations
- Uses TypeScript for type safety

Usage:
- The server can be started with: npm start
- It reads files relative to the working directory
- The main tool is "readme" which reads AGENTS.md

This example file demonstrates that the MCP server can read various text files, not just AGENTS.md files.
